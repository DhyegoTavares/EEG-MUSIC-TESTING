## About the Study

This research investigates the influence of **music (specifically Lo-Fi)** on both **performance (accuracy)** and **neurophysiological activity (via EEG)** of professional software testers during software testing tasks.

A controlled experiment was conducted with **14 professionals**, divided into an **experimental group** (exposed to music) and a **control group** (in silence).  
The testing tasks were divided into four blocks:

1. Test code comprehension  
2. Syntax error detection  
3. Logical error identification  
4. Test case creation  

The results indicate that the group exposed to music achieved **higher accuracy** in analytical tasks but **slightly lower performance** in the generative task (test case creation).  
Neurologically, the music group exhibited **more stable EEG activity** (notably in the **Beta** and **Delta** bands) and **greater Alpha desynchronization (ERD)** during analytical tasks, suggesting **higher concentration**
when listening music while doing mechanical tasks.

## EEG Data

### Raw Data (Zenodo)

The complete raw EEG dataset (~6 GB) is not included in this repository due to its size.
It is **publicly available** and **permanently archived** on **Zenodo**.

**DOI:** https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.17457949


## Data Results

The `/data` directory provides all results from the experiment, organized as follows:

* **Wave_ELE**: Power of specific waves by **electrode** and activity.
* **Wave_IND**: Power of specific waves by **participant** and activity.
* **Wave_REG**: Power of specific waves by **brain region** and activity.


## Replication Package

In the `/replication` directory, you will find the zip file `prophet_eeg_study.zip` which includes:

- The PROPHET experimental infrastructure tool (Java-based), used to plan and execute the experiment.
- All 12 testing tasks (Java/Selenium code snippets) presented to participants — as detailed in Appendix C of the dissertation.

## Data Analysis Scripts

The MATLAB scripts used for preprocessing and analysis are available in the `/scripts` directory.

Requirements:

- MATLAB R2018b or later

- EEGLAB v2023.1 or later


## Execution Order

1. **ICA.m**
Run this script first with all raw `.EDF` files from the experiment.
It applies **Independent Component Analysis (ICA)** for artifact removal (e.g., eye blinks, muscle activity).

2. **Unified_GUI.m** (or **UniGui** script)
Run this script with the `.SET` files generated by `ICA.m.`
It applies a band-pass filter to retain frequencies between 0.5 and 50 Hz.

3. **eeg_q_Script.m** or **eeg_q_Unified_Region_Script.m**
Run one of these scripts on the filtered `.SET` files.
They compute the **Power Spectral Density (PSD)** using the **Welch method** and generate the final data files stored in `/data.`

**Note:** If you need to merge `.EDF` files before analysis, use the included utility script `MergeEDF.m.`

## Summary

This repository was designed to support o**pen science and reproducibility** by providing all materials necessary 
to replicate and extend the study described in the dissertation:

> **Cruz, Dhyego T. M. (2025). Effects of Music on Brain Activity and Performance of Software Testing Professionals: 
An Experimental Study with EEG. Federal University of Bahia (UFBA).**

The combination of EEG data, experiment design, and MATLAB scripts enables researchers to replicate the findings or 
explore new analyses on cognitive performance and neural activity during software testing tasks.
